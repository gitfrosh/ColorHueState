# ColorHueState | Contracts

This project includes the smart contract (ColorHueState.sol) for the
ColorHueState digital art project by Jurgen Ostarhild and accompanying contracts. It comes also with a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

To redeploy try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
