ColorHueState (CHS) is an open-ended on-chain SVG-engraving of the heartbeat of the Ethereum blockchain. Each hash of the current block height is materialized into a chromatic composition of four concentric rings encompassing the RGB color space. CHS is connected to the incessant cadences in decentralized technologies – a continuous present of irrevocable time pockets with the opportunity for anyone to catch the visual glimpse of such unique moments. ColorHueState is a memento token of a quarter of a minute of permanence.
